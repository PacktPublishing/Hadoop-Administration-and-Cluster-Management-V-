## About the Video Course
Hadoop is one of the most popular Big Data solutions for reliable and scalable distributed computing and storage. Administering your Hadoop cluster is the key to exploiting its rich features, and get the most out of it. This course focuses on planning, deploying and monitoring your cluster’s performance and looking at the optimal performance and health of this organizational cluster infrastructure. This course will help you understand the basics of Hadoop administration, with comprehensive coverage of various administrative tasks using the popular Apache Hadoop distribution.

This video course will start by installing the Apache Hadoop for cluster installation and configuring the required services. You will also learn various cluster operations like validations, and expanding and shrinking Hadoop services.

You will then move onto gain a better understanding of administrative tasks like planning your cluster, monitoring, logging, security, troubleshooting and best practices. Techniques to keep your Hadoop clusters highly available and reliant are also covered in this course. By the end of this course, you will have a thorough understanding of the concepts related to Hadoop administration.
